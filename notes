attach and counter hane:
 * 3rd line invasion, pincer, then attach under 4th line stone and look for the counterhane
 * on 3 space 3rd to 4th line extension instead of invasion attach to 4th line stone:
  * both ladders are needed
  * similar outcome low invasion with wedge
 * instead of cap just touch from above on a 3rd line stone to make it overconcentrated and low:
  * look again for the counter hane
  * or just jump to separate if the opponent extends instead of a hane

breaking a base:
 * 3rd line 2 space extension, between the stones is one eye
 * play shoulder hit
 * erase higher line eyespace
 * press the opponent down

go technician:
 * don't react right away
 * look around near the area
 * make a connection
 * leaning attack

opening:
 * influence needs extension move!  or it is wasted
 * 4th line is not complete
 * urgent before large
 * don't get surrounded
 * territory with open door is not as big
 * Don't fight too soon.  You might lose sente and the opponent gets a big move.

white opening:
 * counter approach
 * counter pincer
 * tenuki
 * split, small areas then komi matters, don't let black build large moyo
 * speed
 * simple

black opening:
 * approach on the neutral side
 * let white approach on your side
 * attack and build moyo so that komi looses value

6-7-8 / tsumego in a game:
 * 6 dead, 7 depends, 8 alive
 * even in the corner
 * minimize eyespace
 * than 1 2 3 reading
